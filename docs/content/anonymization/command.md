# Anonymization command

Considering your anonymization has been configured, you can
now anonymize a backup file by running:

```sh
console db-tools:anonymize path/to/your/backup/to/anonymized
```

This command will successively:

1. Backup your local database,
2. Restore the given backup file,
3. Anonymize the data from the given backup file,
4. Backup the newly anonymized database, **by overwritting the given backup file**,
5. Restore your database to its original state from the backup produced at step 1.

::: warning
The `db-tools:anonymize` command alone is not enough to ensure you follow GDPR best practices.
It depends on:

* How you correctly configured your anonymization (obviously),
* Where you run this command: anonymizing a backup file means it contains
  sensitive data, hence, following GDPR recommendations, this **backup file
  should never transit on an unsecured environment**.

## Options

You can specify the behavior of the  `db-tools:anonymize`command with some options detailed below.

### Anonymizing local database

The main purpose of this command is to provide a way to anonymize a backup file. But
it could also be used to anonymize local database with `--local-database`.

```sh
console db-tools:anonymize --local-database
```

### Do not restore initial state after anonymization

You can choose to not restore initial database with the `--no-restore` option.
With this option, steps 1 and 5 will be skipped during execution.

```sh
console db-tools:anonymize --no-restore
```

### Only anonymize specific targets

Use this option if you want to anonymize only some specific targets during the process.

```sh
console db-tools:anonymize --target target_1 --taget target_2
# or
console db-tools:anonymize -t target_1 -t target_2
```

::: tip
To know all your available targets, launch `db-tools:anonymization:dump-config`
:::

### Exclude targets from anonymization

Use this option if you want to exclude some specific targets from anonymization.

```sh
console db-tools:anonymize --exclude target_1 --exclude target_2
# or
console db-tools:anonymize -x target_1 -x target_2
```

::: tip
To know all your available targets, launch `db-tools:anonymization:dump-config`
:::

### Split update queries

By default, the anonymization process use one update query per table.
For debug purpose, it could be usefull to run not only one update query per table
but one update query per target. To do so, use the `--split-per-column` option.

::: info
Learn more about how the anonymization process builds these update queries reading
the [Internals section](./internals).
