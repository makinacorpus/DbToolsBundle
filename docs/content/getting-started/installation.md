## Installation

Add the *DbToolsBundle* to your Symfony project with [composer](https://getcomposer.org):

```sh
composer require makinacorpus/db-tools-bundle
```

Then, activate the bundle:

```php
// config/bundles.php

return [
    Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\FrameworkBundle::class => ['all' => true],
    //...
    Doctrine\Bundle\DoctrineBundle\DoctrineBundle::class => ['all' => true],
    Doctrine\Bundle\MigrationsBundle\DoctrineMigrationsBundle::class => ['all' => true],
    // ...
    MakinaCorpus\DbToolsBundle\DbToolsBundle::class => ['all' => true], // [!code ++]
];
```

Finally, copy the default configuration file from the vendor directory:

```sh
cd your_project_dir
cp vendor/makinacorpus/db-tools-bundle/config/packages/db_tools.yaml config/packages/
```

Feel free to read this configuration file, it will learn you basics about this bundle.

**That's it, *DbToolsBundle* is now ready to be used.**

But before starting to use it, check if the *DbToolsBundle* succeeds to find
backup and restore binaries for your(s) Doctrine connection(s):

```sh
php bin/console db-tools:check
```

:::tip
If this command returns some errors, go to the [binaries configuration](../configuration#binaries)
section to understand how to solve them.
