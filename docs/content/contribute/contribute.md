## Contribution rules

While we want DbToolsBundle to be a community project, **we do not accept any kind of contribution**.

We ask our contributors to follow these simple rules:

### 1 PR = 1 issue

First of all, we demand our contributor to respect our workflow : before submitting a PR, we want
you to create an associated issue.

 _A PR which is not associated with an issue won't be read and will be closed._

### Basic courtesy

Each issue and PR must be introduced with a clear description that expose the problem it solves or the feature
it implements.

_Each wild PR that does not comply with this rule won't be read_

### Ok for IA, but in good intelligence

While we are no big fan of IA, we accept our contributor to use it.

**But**, we won't accept completly vide-coded PRs. Also, a PR that does not appear to have been properly reviewed by its own author after using AI will be closed: **it is not our job to review your bad IA work**.
