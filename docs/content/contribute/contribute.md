## Contribution rules

While we want DbToolsBundle to be a community project, **we do not accept any kind of contribution**.

We ask our contributors to follow these simple rules:

### Basic courtesy

Each issue and PR must be introduced with a clear description that expose the problem it solves or the feature
it implements.

_Each wild PR that does not comply with this rule won't be read_

### PR without associated issue

Note that we accept PR which are not relative to an existing issue (as long as it complies with the previous rule).

But we encourage you not do it. Proposing a PR without discussing the problem/feature with maintainers can
lead to useless work.

### Split your contributions

It is much easier for maintainers to review small PRs that solve one and only one issue.

- Do not correct multiple issues in the same ticket (unless discussed and approved in advance).
- Do not make changes that are too invasive or too large (unless discussed and approved in advance).

### Mind the documentation

We care a lot about documentation and changelog.

We consider that a feature which is not documented does not exist. So if you add a new
feature, document it in the correct section of our documentation.

Whether you are fixing a bug or developing a new feature: mention it in the `CHANGELOG.md` file.

This file already contains a lot of content, you should quickly understand the expected syntax.

### Ask for help

If you encounter problem while contributing, we encourage you to ask us for help.

Don't hesitate to push draft PRs and to ping maintainers!

### Ok for AI, but in good intelligence

While we are no big fans of AI, we accept our contributors to use it.

**But**

Your use of AI should not cost to us. AI is just a tool to produce code, it is your responsability to ensure that
the produced code complies with all the previous rules.

This being said:

- We won't accept completely vide-coded PRs.
- A PR that does not appear to have been properly reviewed by its own author after using AI will be closed.
