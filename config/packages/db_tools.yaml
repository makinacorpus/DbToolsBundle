    # Filename strategies. You may specify one strategy for each doctrine
    # connection. Keys are doctrine connection names. Values are strategy
    # names, "default" (or null) or omitting the connection will use the
    # default implementation.
    # If you created and registered a custom one into the container as a
    # service, you may simply set the service identifier. If no service
    # exists, and your implementation does not require parameters, simply
    # set the class name.
    # Allowed values are:
    #  - "default": alias of "datetime".
    #  - "datetime": implementation is "%db_tools.storage_directory%/YYYY/MM/<connection-name>-<datestamp>.<ext>".

    # Update this configuration if you want to look for anonymizers in a custom folder.
    # These are default paths that will always be registered even if you override
    # the setting so please don't repeat them:

        #- '%kernel.project_dir%/vendor/makinacorpus/db-tools-bundle/src/Anonymization/Anonymizer/Core'
        #- '%kernel.project_dir%/src/Anonymization/Anonymizer'

    # For simple needs, you may simply write the anonymization configuration here.
    # Keys are connection names, values are structures which are identical to what
    # you may find in the "anonymizations.sample.yaml" example.
    #anonymization:
    #    connection_one:
    #        table1:
    #            column1:
    #                anonymizer: anonymizer_name
    #                # ... anonymizer specific options...
    #            column2:
    #            # ...
    #        table2:
    #            # ...
    #    connection_two:
    #        # ...

    # You can for organisation purpose delegate anonymization config into extra
    # YAML configuration files, and simply reference them here.
    # Pathes can be either relative or absolute. Relative paths are relative to
    #Â the workdir option if specified, or from this configuration file directory
    # otherwise.
    # See the "anonymizations.sample.yaml" in this folder for an example.
    #anonymization_files:
    #    connection_one: '%kernel.project_dir%/config/anonymization/connection_one.yaml'
    #    connection_two: '%kernel.project_dir%/config/anonymization/connection_two.yaml'

    # If you have only one connection, you can adopt the following syntax.
    #anonymization_files: '%kernel.project_dir%/config/anonymizations.yaml'
