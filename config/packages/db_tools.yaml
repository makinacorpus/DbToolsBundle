    # Update this configuration if you want to look for anonymizers in a custom
    # folder.
    # Be aware that DbToolsBundle will always take a look at the default folder

    # so you don't have to repeat it.

    #    - '%kernel.project_dir%/src/Database/Anonymizer'

    # For simple needs, you may simply write the anonymization configuration
    # here. Keys are connection names, values are structures which are identical
    # to what you may find in the "anonymizations.sample.yaml" example.
    #anonymization:
    #    connection_one:
    #        table1:
    #            column1:
    #                anonymizer: anonymizer_name
    #                # ... anonymizer specific options...
    #            column2:
    #            # ...
    #        table2:
    #            # ...
    #    connection_two:
    #        # ...

    # You can for organisation purpose delegate anonymization config into extra
    # YAML configuration files, and simply reference them here.
    # Paths can be either relative or absolute. Relative paths are relative to
    # the workdir option if specified, or from this configuration file directory
    # otherwise.
    # See the "anonymizations.sample.yaml" in this folder for an example.

    #    connection_one: '%kernel.project_dir%/config/anonymization/connection_one.yaml'

    # If you have only one connection, you can adopt the following syntax.
