# This configuration file is an example for standalone usage.
# Only required parameter is the connection URL.

# If you have a single connection, you can use this syntax.
# Connection name will be "default" when configured this way.
# If you have multiple connections, please refer to the exhaustive
# sample in 'db_tools.standalone.complete.sample.yaml'.
connections: "pgsql://username:password@hostname:port?version=16.0&other_option=..."

# Where to put generated backups.
# Root directory of the backup storage manager. Default filename
# strategy will always use this folder as root path.
#storage_directory: ./var/db_tools

# Default filename strategy. You may specify one strategy for each connection.
# If you created and registered a custom one into the container as a
# service, you may simply set the service identifier. If no service
# exists, and your implementation does not require parameters, simply
# set the class name.
# Allowed values are:
#  - "default": alias of "datetime".
#  - "datetime": implementation is "%db_tools.storage_directory%/YYYY/MM/<connection-name>-<datestamp>.<ext>".
#  - CLASS_NAME: a class name to use that implements a strategy.
#storage_filename_strategy: default

# When old backups are considered obsolete.
# (Use relative date/time formats : https://www.php.net/manual/en/datetime.formats.relative.php)
#backup_expiration_age: '6 months ago' # default '3 months ago'

# List here tables (you don't want in your backups.
# If you have more than one connection, it is strongly advised to configure
# this for each connection instead.
#backup_excluded_tables: ['table1', 'table2']

# Update this configuration if you want to look for anonymizers in a custom folder.
#anonymizer_paths:
    #- ./src/Anonymization/Anonymizer'

# Write the anonymization configuration here.
# You may also write anonymization configuration in extra files instead, please
# see the 'db_tools.standalone.complete.sample.yaml' for more documentation.
#anonymization:
#    # Keys are connection names, values are structures which are identical to what
#    # you may find in the "anonymizations.sample.yaml" example.
#    # If you only specified one URL in the "connections" parameter above, the
#    # connection name is "default".
#    default:
#        # Keys here are table names, followed by column names, column values
#        # are either an anonymizer name string, or an object with options.
#        user:
#            # Some Anonymizer does not require any option, you can use them like this
#            prenom: fr-fr.firstname
#            nom: fr-fr.lastname
#            # Some do require options, specify them like this:
#            age:
#                anonymizer: integer
#                options: {min: 0, max: 99}
#            # Some others have optionnal options, you can specify those:
#            email:
#                anonymizer: email
#                options: {domain: 'toto.com'}
#            # Or leave it with defaults:
#            email: email
#            level:
#                anonymizer: string
#                options: {sample: ['none', 'bad', 'good', 'expert']}
#        # ... other tables...
