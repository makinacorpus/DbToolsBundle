# This configuration file is an example for standalone usage.
#
# The given parameters you will find in this file must not be set in a Symfony
# application context, and will ignored if so.
#
# All other configuration you can find in the ./packages/db_tools.yaml file
# can be added in this file, you must simply omit the 'db_tools:' top level
# node.

# Working directory is the path to which all relative file references will
# be relative to. If none set, the path will be this file directory instead.
workdir: /var/www/my_project/

# Database connections.
# One line per connection, a single database URL, all options as query
# parameters. Connections will be made using makincorpus/query-builder
# which will raise exceptions when invalid options are found.
# There is less configuration amplitude than using doctrine/dbal in
# Symfony, yet it should be enough in most case.
# In case any options or specific behaviour is missing, please file
# an issue at https://github.com/makinacorpus/php-query-builder/issues
connections:
    connection_one: "pgsql://username:password@hostname:port?version=16.0&other_option=..."
    connection_two: "mysql://username:password@hostname:port?version=8.1&other_option=..."

# You can explicitely set which will be default connection in use when
# none providen in the command line options. If you omit this configuration
# vlaue, then the first one in the list will be used.

# Storage is autoconfigured when using Symfony, but when using this
# application standalone, it's on your own. You must provide at least
# a root directory for backups.
storage:
    # Path can be relative, it will be relative to the configuration file.
    # If none provided, the default will be the following one.
    root_dir: ./var/db_tools

# From here, all options in the 'db_tools' section of Symfony configuration
# can be added, including anonymization files configuration.

anonymization:
    # From here you can proceed with manual file inclusion. Pathes can be
    # either relative or absolute. Relative paths are relative to and resolved
    # from this configuration file.
    yaml:
        connection_one: ./db_tools.anonymizer.connection_one.yaml
        # ... other connections ...

    # Extra configuration options, if you don't want to split the anonymization
    # configuration into multiple files, you can directly write it here. If you
    # use the entity dump capability, you can copy paste the result directly
    # here.
