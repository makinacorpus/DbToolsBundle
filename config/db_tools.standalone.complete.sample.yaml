# This configuration file is an example for standalone usage.
# Only required parameter is the connection URL.

# Working directory is the path to which all relative file references will
# be relative to. If none set, the path will be this file directory instead.
# In most cases, you will not need it.
#workdir: .

# Where to put generated backups.
# Root directory of the backup storage manager. Default filename
# strategy will always use this folder as root path.
#storage_directory: ./var/db_tools

# Default filename strategy. You may specify one strategy for each doctrine
# connection.
# If you created and registered a custom one into the container as a
# service, you may simply set the service identifier. If no service
# exists, and your implementation does not require parameters, simply
# set the class name.
# Allowed values are:
#  - "default": alias of "datetime".
#  - "datetime": implementation is "%db_tools.storage_directory%/YYYY/MM/<connection-name>-<datestamp>.<ext>".
#  - CLASS_NAME: a class name to use that implements a strategy.
#storage_filename_strategy: default

# When old backups are considered obsolete.
# (Use relative date/time formats : https://www.php.net/manual/en/datetime.formats.relative.php)
#backup_expiration_age: '6 months ago' # default '3 months ago'

# Default timeout for backup process.
#backup_timeout: 1200 # default 600

# Default timeout for restore process.
#restore_timeout: 2400 # default 1800

# List here tables (you don't want in your backups.
# If you have more than one connection, it is strongly advised to configure
# this for each connection instead.
#backup_excluded_tables: ['table1', 'table2']

# Specify here paths to backup and restore binaries and command line options.
# Warning: this will apply to all connections disregarding their database
# vendor. If you have more than one connection and if they use different
# database vendors or versions, please configure those for each connection
# instead.
# Default values depends upon vendor and are documented at
# https://dbtoolsbundle.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuration.html

# If you have a single connection, you can use this syntax.
# Connection name will be "default" when configured this way.
connections: "pgsql://username:password@hostname:port?version=16.0&other_option=..."

# Alternatively, you are allowed to have more than one connections, case
# in which you might synthesize the configuration as this:

#    connection_one: "pgsql://username:password@hostname:port?version=16.0&other_option=..."
#    connection_two: "mysql://username:password@hostname:port?version=8.1&other_option=..."

# For advanced usage, you may also override any parameter for each connection.
# Each key is a connection name, all parameters above are allowed for each
# unique connection.

#    connection_one:
#        # Connection URL for connecting.
#        # Please refer to makinacorpus/db-query-builder or  documentation for more information.
#        # Any URL built for doctrine/dbal usage should work.
#        # URL is the sole mandatory parameter.

# Update this configuration if you want to look for anonymizers in a custom folder.
#anonymizer_paths:
    #- ./src/Anonymization/Anonymizer'

# For simple needs, you may simply write the anonymization configuration here.
# Keys are connection names, values are structures which are identical to what

anonymization:
    connection_one:
        table1:

        table2:
            # ...
    connection_two:
        # ...

# You can for organisation purpose delegate anonymization config into extra
# YAML configuration files, and simply reference them here.
# Pathes can be either relative or absolute. Relative paths are relative to
#Â the workdir option if specified, or from this configuration file directory
# otherwise.
# See the "anonymizations.sample.yaml" in this folder for an example.
